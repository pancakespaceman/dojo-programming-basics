// Week 2 Day 1
// Countdown by Fours
// Print positive numbers starting with 2020, counting down by fours (excluding 0)
//     Challenge:Do this with a FOR loop first and then do it using a WHILE loop afterwards
//  loop variable; condition; increment/decrement
for (var i = 2020; i > 1; i -= 4) {
  console.log(i);
}

// condition
var number = 40 //made my loop variable outside the loop
while (number > 1) {
  console.log(number);
  number -= 4;
}
 
// Level Up: Flexible Countdown
// Based on Countdown by fours, write a function that, given parameters of "lowNum", "highNum", and "mult", 
// print all multiples of "mult" from "highNum" to "lowNum" using a for loop
// Example: flexCount(2,9,3), it will print 9 6 3 on successive lines.
// Example: flexCount(2,16,3), it will print 15 12 9 6 3 on successive lines.

function flexCount(lowNum, highNum, mult){}

flexCount(2, 9, 3)

// modulus operator
// 13 % 4 => 1
// 12 % 4 => 0
// 8 % 3 => 2
// 9 % 3 => 0
// 9 % 2 => 1
 
// Sensei Bonus:
// This is based on "Flexible Countdown." The parameter names are not as helpful, but the problem is essentially identical; don't be thrown off! 
// Given 4 parameters (param1, param2, param3, param4), print the multiples of param1, starting at param2, and extending to parm3.
// There's one exception: if a multiple is equal to param4, then  skip it (don't print it). Do this using a while loop.
// Example: Given (3,5,17,9), the output should be 6,12,15 on successive lines, because 6,12, and 15 are multiples of 3, 
// between 5 and 17, and excludes the value of 9.
